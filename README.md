## Description

Duration: 5 hours

The JQuery Salary Calculator solves the problem of keeping track of a monthly budget for employees. Employees can be added with first and last name, employee ID, and their annual salary in separate inputs and the page will update to reflect the total monthly cost upon clicking the submit button. When the budget of \$20,000 has been exceeded the total monthly cost will show up against a red background. After employees are added they will appear in a table that contains all relevent information and a button to delete them from the table if the employee is terminated. After future updates the total monthly cost and array containing the employees will show the appropriate information when an employee is terminated.

An example of the website can be found in the files.
